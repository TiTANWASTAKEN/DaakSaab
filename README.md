Doctor's Portal
This project is a full-stack web application for a doctor's portal, where patients can register, book appointments with doctors, and doctors can manage appointments and patient details. It includes both a front-end (for patients and doctors) and a back-end (for managing appointments, users, prescriptions, and notes).

Features
For Patients:
Registration: Patients can create an account to register.
Login: Patients can log into their accounts.
Book Appointments: Patients can schedule an appointment with available doctors.
View Appointments: Patients can see their upcoming and past appointments.
For Doctors:
Login: Doctors can log into their accounts.
View Appointments: Doctors can see all booked appointments.
Manage Appointments: Doctors can accept, reschedule, or cancel appointments.
Notes & Prescriptions: Doctors can keep track of patient notes and prescriptions.
Tech Stack
Front-end: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (or MySQL, PostgreSQL depending on your choice)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
Deployment: You can deploy the backend with services like Heroku, and the frontend can be deployed with Netlify or Vercel.
